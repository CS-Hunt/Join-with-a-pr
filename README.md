# Get Placed + geeks community

Our sole mission is to help you recognize your potential and purpose. We believe that everyone has a gift in himself or herself but are not able to see it. We will help you in every possible way. Just ask us!

Some of our core beliefs are:

* Assist others in realizing their highest potential.
* To provide a safe environment for the free exchange of ideas.
* Reduce the amount of time you spend seeking and instead spend more time studying, talking, and interacting.
* To build a community where everybody, regardless of where they live on the planet, may participate.
